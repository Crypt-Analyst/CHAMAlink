                                It all started in 2007, when I was just 8 years old during the challenging siku za Moi era. 
                                I witnessed my grandmother, Joyce Mwato, transform our family's financial future through her local Chama.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every Saturday morning, I watched my grandmother walk miles to sit under a large acacia tree 
                                with twelve other women. Each carrying a small envelope containing 100 Kenyan Shillings - 
                                a significant amount for rural families during those difficult economic times.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That experience made me think about technology every day. I couldn't understand why such 
                                powerful community work required so much physical effort.

                                In 2010, when I was 11, my mother Judith Lily joined my grandmother's chama. 
                                Watching both of them walk those long distances to attend meetings broke my heart.

                                They never gave up, despite the challenges. Rain or shine, they would make that journey. 
                                Their dedication was inspiring, but I knew there had to be a better way.
